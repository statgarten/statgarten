## How to add an article

1.  Make Rmarkdown file (`.rmd`)

Statgarten's articles are written in Rmarkdown. You can make a new Rmarkdown file by clicking `File > New File > Rmarkdown...` in RStudio.

Directory should be like below

```         
<PACKAGE>/vignettes/articles/<your_article.Rmd>
```

Also you can customize subdirectory below vignettes. 
For example in this repository, we use **articles**, **extra**, **packages**, **usage**, **welcome** (structure like navigation)

2.  Write your article

In this article, we don't explain how to write an article in Rmarkdown. see <a href = 'https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html' target = "_blank">Rmarkdown</a> for more information.

There isn't strict rule to write an article yet. 

- But, it's recommend to write your article in English. 
- Use `##` and `---` to separate each paragraph (not `#`) 
- It's good to use emoji. try <a href = 'https://emojidb.org/' target = "_blank">EmojiDB</a>

After writing article, You can use `rmarkdown::render()` to check your article.

3. Modify `_pkgdown.yml` file

You should add your article's name in `_pkgdown.yml` file. 

below is part of yml file from statgarten's repository (this repository)
```yml
navbar:
  components:
    welcome:
      text: "‚õ≥ Project"
      menu:
        - text: "What is statgarten?"
          href: articles/welcome/project.html
        - text: "üôã How to Contribute"
          href: articles/welcome/contribute.html
        - text: "How to add article to pkgdownsite"
          href: articles/welcome/addarticle.html
        - text: "üé® Statgarten Design System üîó"
          href: https://github.com/statgarten/SGDG/
          target: _blank
        - text: "ü§ùüèª Partners"
          href: articles/welcome/partner.html
```

As you can see, there are 2 main concept below `menu` structure: `text`, `href`

`text` is the name of your article (in webpage). `href` is the path of your article.

However, `href` should be `.html` file (which is rendered result of `.rmd` file)

4. Build pkgdown site.

You can use below code:

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

5. Commit and make a PR to statgarten's repository (or for each package)
